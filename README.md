# nand2tetris
A repo dedicated to the assembly of a Hack computer (from logic gates to high level programming).

**HEADS-UP: this is an ongoing project**

As the subtitle suggests, this repo contains my solutions to all the sets of assignments present in the Nand2tetris course, created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, professors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 

For additional info on the Nand2tetris course, please visit **https://www.nand2tetris.org/**.

The course can be found on Coursera and is based on the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" (MIT Press).

The main goal is to attain a deep understanding about the inner workings of computers by creating (1) basic and complex logic gates; (2) adder chips and a functional ALU; (3) memory chips; (4) machine instructions; (5) a hardware architecture; (6) an assembler; (7) a compiler; (8) an OS; and, finally, (8) a high-level computer language.

The hardware is descripted in a simplified (but rather interesting) HDL - hardware description language. All the chips have been tested with the correspective .tst files.
